Advocating the open-source philosophy, I'm at home with Linux and host all my projects on publicly accessible repositories. Proficient in hardware development using microcontrollers and Single Board Computers, I bring a hands-on approach to my work. Recently, I've delved into web applications and cloud tools, particularly those integrating AI and ML into audio. Eager to contribute and collaborate in the ever-evolving landscape of audio programming, I am driven by a passion to push boundaries and explore innovative solutions."

As time rolled on, I found myself drawn to the world of composing music, diving into various genres including classical, contemporary, electroacoustic, jazz, tango, and the vibrant sounds of Argentine folklore. I'm captivated by the magic of blending different instruments, crafting arrangements for groups that resonate, and immersing myself in the intriguing complexities of modern harmony."

Within this creative sphere, sound design transforms into a dynamic playground, pushing boundaries and sculpting distinctive auditory experiences. Expanding further, my artistic motivations lead me into the world of sound installations, where crafted spaces amplify storytelling through sound. My fascination extends to soundscape works, weaving an interplay of sonic textures from natural and urban environments. Collaborating with choreography and performance, my compositions integrate with bodies, movement, and narrative, transforming the performative realm into an immersive and interconnected multisensory experience."

In the artistic field, there are few examples where the parameter of the ADP / VDP has been used as an organizer of sound elements, building a space in which the listener is able, for example, to recognize patterns of trajectories or different textures and planes in depth. The general objective of this work focuses on conducting an investigation with a double perspective:\n \n <ul><li>to study how the visual and auditory modalities interact to modulate the distance perception in humans,</li>\n <li>to apply the results obtained in the research as a compositional alternative applicable to the sound production.</li></ul>"

Why return to the cave of images? Sacrificing an archive: disassembling it, reordering it, dismembering it, subjecting it to the present, to an interrogation with other perspectives and new intertextualities; creating a sonic, audiovisual, and performative device that provides new meanings to what was a vector of intuition and conviction; ALL BEGINNINGS ARE FALSE aims to be a living artifact of memory, a telepathic conversation about friendship and the stage, the possibility of a choral existence, a provisional certainty that beginnings do not exist, or perhaps, never stop happening.",

In particular, from the point of view of the sound treatment of the work, the idea of memory as noise was approached as a key concept for the composition of the sound space.
